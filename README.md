Longest Common Subsequence's Algorithms
=======================================

LCS Algotihms is use for find longest common sub sequence from given two string using dynamic programming in C language.

To compile the code, type: make

To run the code, type : ./lcs.out <input file.txt>

Input file should like : (Catuation first line should be null terminated, however second line is not.)
ABCSA
BCDD

Output: <Common Sequence> <Size of Sequence>
BC 2
